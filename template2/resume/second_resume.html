                        researching keywords, optimize content, and tackle technical SEO for
                        new site launches. I also focus on B2B websites, running marketing 
                        campaigns to generate leads. On top of that, I conduct title research for 
                        our internal blogs to boost traffic and keep our content engaging. My goal
